    abstract = {The dilatation of a pseudo-Anosov braid is a conjugacy invariant. In this paper, we study the dilatation of a special family of pseudo-Anosov braids. We prove an inductive formula to compute their dilatation, a monotonicity and an asymptotic behavior of the dilatation for this family of braids. We also give an example of a family of pseudo-Anosov braids with arbitrarily small dilatation such that the mapping torus obtained from such braid has 2 cusps and has an arbitrarily large volume.},

@article{Hironaka2009,
    abstract = {This paper describes a family of pseudo-Anosov braids with small dilatation. The smallest dilatations occurring for braids with 3, 4 and 5 strands appear in this family. A pseudo-Anosov braid with 2g+1 strands determines a hyperelliptic mapping class with the same dilatation on a genus-g surface. Penner showed that logarithms of least dilatations of pseudo-Anosov maps on a genus-g surface grow asymptotically with the genus like 1/g, and gave explicit examples of mapping classes with dilatations bounded above by log 11/g. Bauer later improved this bound to log 6/g. The braids in this paper give rise to mapping classes with dilatations bounded above by log(2+sqrt(3))/g. They show that least dilatations for hyperelliptic mapping classes have the same asymptotic behavior as for general mapping classes on genus-g surfaces.},

@article{Band2006,
    abstract = {The topological entropy of a braid is the infimum of the entropies of all homeomorphisms of the disc which have a finite invariant set represented by the braid. When the isotopy class represented by the braid is pseudo-Anosov or is reducible with a pseudo-Anosov component, this entropy is positive. Fried and Kolev proved that the entropy is bounded below by the logarithm of the spectral radius of the braid's Burau matrix, $B(t)$, after substituting a complex number of modulus~1 in place of $t$. In this paper we show that for a pseudo-Anosov braid the estimate is sharp for the substitution of a root of unity if and only if it is sharp for $t=-1$. Further, this happens if and only if the invariant foliations of the pseudo-Anosov map have odd order singularities at the strings of the braid and all interior singularities have even order. An analogous theorem for reducible braids is also proved.},

As a result we obtain three new polynomial invariants of [F], one of them being the product of the other two, and all three being divisors of det(xI-T). The degrees of the new polynomials are invariants of [F ] and we give simple formulas for computing them by a counting argument from an invariant train track. We give examples of genus 2 pseudo-Anosov maps having the same dilatation, and use our invariants to distinguish them.},
